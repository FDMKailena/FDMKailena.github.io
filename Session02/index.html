     The womens slippers is lined with high-density memory foam that really reduces the pressure of your feet. These slippers for women really pamper your feet in cozy softness and keep each of your steps like walking on the pillows.</p>
     <p class="graytxt"><span class="subhead"> Do these stretch over time? Lots of folks say order a size up, but I'm worried that after a month the size up will have stretched so that it's too big</span><br>
       Mine are still pretty new but I did find mine true to size. Just don't know if they will stretch, but just a little to make them quite cozy.<br>

   Sometimes it's hard to find a slipper the correct size since someone has decided that slippers can range from two sizes (example: 7-8 or 9-10) I wear an exact 7. The 7 to 8 sizing is too big. The 5 to 6 is too small, so was happy to find a slipper that is an exact size. The extra soft lining of the inside was a very pleasant surprise. Have had them for a month and half and am still loving how soft and perfect they are.<br>

  I love the color. They are very soft. I wear 8.5 and purchased size 9 fits perfect. They stay on my feet unlike the zillions of previous slippers I purchased.<br>
